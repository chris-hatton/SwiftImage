# SwiftImage
An image manipulation and conversion library for (Cocoa Touch)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_Touch], in Swift

**SwiftImage** is a work-in-progress library for manipulating and converting between the numerous image representations that exist
in (Cocoa Touch)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_Touch] and it's associated frameworks.  These are:

- **UIImage** 		(UIKit)
- **CGImage** 		(CoreGraphics)
- **CIImage** 		(CoreImage)
- **CVImageBuffer** (CoreVideo)

**SwiftImage** also offers it's own more Swift-like representation of an Image, **GenericImage**.

**SwiftImage** is being developed in conjunction with a demo App, **SwiftImageDemo**.
If you have an interest, I welcome collaboration on both of these sub-projects.
